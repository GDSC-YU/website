This is the Google developer student club at Al-Yamamah University official website, it is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) <3.

There we announce various events, challenges, and workshops, led by experts in the field. We showcase projects that we worked on and tease about upcoming ones, and our very cool team members üòé <sup> who made it all possible!</sup>

P.S. We also have a cool looking GDSC 3D model ;)
